							<p>The 60s scoop was a time were indigenous kids were taken away from there families and their communities then were put in foster care that was no
								were near any indigenous communities or they were sent to be adopted by white parents and the placed residential schools where they were essentially
								stripped of there languages, culture, And way of life. Although it is called the sixties scoop it stared in the late1950s and the program ended in the
								mid-late 1980s.</p>

								<h3>Unjust Government</h3>
								<p>The kids at residential schools were punished if they spoke there languages and practiced their culture. A lot of the kids put in foster homes 
									were never adopted by people the government deemed acceptable l to raise a child as people of indigenous descent could not adopt these
									kids only white families could,as in the government’s eyes they were right to raise children</p>

								<h3> Who is mooch </h3>
								<p>In the play were the blood mixes we are introducded to a character named mooch. Mooch is of indigenous descent and has had experiences in a residential school.” Mooch there he had it real bad. Hell, ya mooch you will be loaded”.
									I think his experiences has changed him for the worst as in the play as his name would imply he is a mooch or a parasite that feeds of others and does really take care of himself.</p>

								<h3>  </h3>
								<p>His girlfriend June is always mad at him because he steals her money to buy himself drinks with his friends, not only that but he gets his friends to buy him beers saying he will buy the next one.
									I think his experiences in the residential school never got explored  and he has not been able to put his missing pieces back together.</p>

								<span class="icon solid major fa-lock accent5"></span>
								<h3> </h3>
								<p>I myself had never been to a place were speaking my own language gets me a punishment or a place that takes me away from my home and forbids me to see my real parents. This kind of experience has l
									eft Mooch broken, unable to coop, he is unable to keep a job, steals from his girlfriend and his buddies as well. Most of these residential schools have destroyed lives with many of the kids that 
									attended the schools have killed themselves or have developed an addiction. </p>
