						<h2>Second post</h2>
						<p>In the play where the blood mixes I feel that the main purpose the author is trying to get us the reader to understande is the importance of communication and family. I feel that communication within a family and or group is very Vitale as they will be the ones
						who care for you as well as the ones you interacted with. Communication and family is important because you’re able to express your feelings your wants and needs with the people around you.</p>

						<p>In where the blood mixes George and Floyd are trying to get mooch to open up about the things that had happened to him in the schools so that he will be able to get the settlement payment and relieve some of his pent-up emotions.“ 
						     if it was real bad….but you gotta talk about it, though.that's the thing eh? you gotta talk about what happened.”This is very important because they are trying to get their friend out of an emotional hole that he has dug himself 
														  into, They are not doing this just because of the money they really care about him like family. I feel that the author was trying to tell us the readers that even if the situation is bad and no matter how much it would hurt talking about it is how you get over it.</p>
						<div class="row">

								<h3></h3>
								<p>When Floyd is getting ready to meet his daughter, he gets all dressed up and he wants to make a good first impression but, he gets into a fight as she walks in then storms off when he sees her there. This is important as things did not go his way and the first thing he can think of doing is running away. As we all no running away from your problems solves nothing. Someone who is apart of his close group of friends June follows him and sits down with him and talks to him allowing him to vent about his disappointment in himself allowing him to build up the courage to talk to his daughter again. This relates back to my point about communication and family without that connection with June he would not have had that emotional boost that he needed to confront his daughter. I can relate this back to my self although it was not the same situation. When I was doing my first performance in front of a live audience I thought I couldn’t do it and it was my pears that had given me the strength to perform</p>

								<h3></h3>
								<p>In a family people need to be able to express there needs if we look at Anne from the play we can see that not expressing your self or talking about something is much worse for you.” she had depression eh…. I mean we all got stuff... hurts, your know but she would get so stuck in it.”. In the world, we live in now many more people suffer from depression and the reason is that they keep to thems selfs not allowing them selfs to get better just like what Anne did. She would get too wrapped up in the past that she could not look forward then she just couldn’t take it anymore and ended her life. I think the message the author is trying to get across here is that no matter what your pasted looked like always look ahead with your family and friends.
                                                                   Communication and family are to of the most important things to keep a healthy mental state. A community that has both thoughts things allow you to be able to share your feelings your needs and want. We are all human beings we all have the right to love and feel. </p>
